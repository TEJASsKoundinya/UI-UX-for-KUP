 A prototype with a camera captures the picture of the plant's leaves and tells whether the plant is healthy or not, if not healthy then classify it based on the disease it has like a mosaic virus, leaf mold, bacterial spot, and so on. 
Later the app proposes a suitable solution that is what kind of pesticides or fertilizers must be used to cure the diseases. The app also calculates the expenditure done by then the farmer and indicates the profit that he made. The prototype also has a temperature and humidity sensor that is used to tell the perfect temperature and humidity to grow the plants and the type of soil required to grow the plants. The app also tells you if the plant needs sunlight depending on the inputs given by the gardener and also depending on the types of plants the gardener has like indoor plants and outdoor plants.
